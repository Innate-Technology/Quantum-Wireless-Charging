# Quantum Wireless Charging

This project explores the concept of Quantum Wireless Charging, which is a method of transferring energy wirelessly between two objects using quantum entanglement.

## Background

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles can be linked in such a way that the state of one particle is correlated with the state of the other particle. This means that information can be transmitted between two entangled particles instantly, regardless of the distance between them.

The idea behind Quantum Wireless Charging is to use this property of entanglement to transfer energy from one object to another, eliminating the need for physical contact or a wired connection. This has the potential to greatly simplify the process of charging devices, as it would allow devices to be charged wirelessly without the need for cords or charging pads.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to:

- Investigate the feasibility of using quantum entanglement for wireless energy transfer.
- Develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept for Quantum Wireless Charging.
- Explore the potential applications and benefits of Quantum Wireless Charging.

## Requirements

- Knowledge of quantum mechanics and entanglement
- Familiarity with wireless energy transfer and charging technology
- Strong programming skills in languages such as Python or MATLAB
